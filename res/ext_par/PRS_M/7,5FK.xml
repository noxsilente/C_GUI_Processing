Proprietary cartridge created by FK BRNO for the FK BRNO Field Pistol.
Although the basic case design and the concept of the cartridge was finalized in 2011, more than 250,000 rounds were fired with at least 15 different case design variations and over 30 different bullet designs were tested over a four-year period before the final cartridge design form was approved for production. 
The case is 27 mm long with a total length of 35 mm, and a head diameter of 10.8 mm. This caliber is not a necked-down version of any other caliber. The case is designed to withstand higher pressures than usually used in pistol calibers.
This cartridge will not fit in any other manufacturer's magazine, nor will it function in any other current production model pistol.
