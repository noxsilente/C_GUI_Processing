The 7mm Penna also known as the 7Ã—23mm is a handgun cartridge designed by Leonardo Penna for law enforcement applications. The cartridge utilises a novel lightweight, pointed projectile made from brass travelling at high velocity with the intention of giving it limited armor-piercing capabilities and greater stopping power.
There has been rumours of Fiocchi of Italy developing this cartridge for the sport of competitive shooting especially for IPSC competitions. STI chambered a few of their Nemesis line of 1911 clones for this cartridge but ceased shortly thereafter due to very little demand for such a handgun in this chambering.
This cartridge family also includes a 7x28mmR rimmed cartridge designed for use in revolvers and longer cartridges for use in carbines and rifles.
