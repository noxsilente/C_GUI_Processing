The 9×25mm Super Auto G, officially known as the 9 × 25 Super Auto G by C.I.P. and unofficially also known as the 9 × 25 Super Auto Grillmeyer, is an Austrian pistol cartridge.
The 10 mm Auto cartridge has functioned as the parent case for the 9×25mm Super Auto G, which is essentially a necked-down version of the 10 mm Auto. The 10 mm Auto cartridge case was used for this since it has the capability to operate with relative high chamber pressures for its case capacity which, combined with smaller and hence lighter bullets result in very high muzzle velocities. 
The cartridge got C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) certified in 1991. The 9×25mm Super Auto G is currently (2009) not commercially available and exists only as a C.I.P. datasheet. It might however still used by a few shooters who produce the cases from 10 mm Auto brass by reshaping the shoulder and neck, and handloading it with 9 mm calibre bullets.
