The .257 Roberts, also known as .257 Bob[2], is a medium-powered .25 caliber cartridge. It has been described as the best compromise between the low recoil 
and flat trajectory of smaller calibers such as the .22 and 6mm, and the strong energy but not the strong recoil of larger popular hunting calibers, such as the 
7mm family and the popular .30-06.
With light bullets the .257 produces little recoil and has a flat trajectory suitable for varmint hunting. With heavier bullets it is capable of taking all but 
the largest North American game animals. The original factory load for this is very similar to the .250-3000 Savage.
