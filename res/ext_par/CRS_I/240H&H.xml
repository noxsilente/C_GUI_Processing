The .240 Magnum Rimless Holland &amp; Holland (also known as the .240 Apex and the .240 Super Express) and the .240 Magnum Flanged are a 
pair of centrefire sporting rifle cartridges developed in English gunmakers Holland &amp; Holland in the 1920s, primarily for use in hunting deer and 
plains game. The ballistic performance of the .240 H&amp;H in factory loads is very similar to that of the .243 Winchester, with a 100-grain (6.5 g) 
bullet with a diameter of .245 inches (contrary to the .240 name) giving a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,900 feet per second (880 m/s). 
When it is loaded at the same pressure as the .243 WSSM using modern powders, the .240 H&amp;H has the potential for slightly better performance. 
Most bolt-action rifles made for the .240 H&amp;H will be amply strong enough to handle handloaded cartridges at high pressure.
