The .17 Hornet is a .17 caliber centerfire rifle cartridge originally offered as a "wildcat cartridge" 
made by P.O. Ackley in the early 1950s. He created this non-factory (wildcat) offering by simply necking-down the .22 Hornet to .17 caliber 
and fire-forming the resized cases in his new chamber design. The result was a small quiet cartridge capable of high velocity. 
Ackley mentions it as one of the most balanced of the .17 cartridges of his time; likely, this is still true
