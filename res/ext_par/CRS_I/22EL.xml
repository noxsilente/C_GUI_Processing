.22 Eargesplitten Loudenboomer is a wildcat rifle cartridge.
This humorously named cartridge was developed in the 1960s by P.O. Ackley for Bob Hutton of Guns &amp; Ammo magazine, and was intended solely to exceed 5,000 ft/s (1,500 m/s) muzzle velocity. Ackley's loads only managed 4,600 ft/s (1,400 m/s)(Mach 4.2), firing a 50-grain (3.2 g) bullet. Based on a .378 Weatherby Magnum case, the case is impractically over-capacity for the bore diameter, and so the cartridge remains a curiosity. 
The advent of new slower-burning smokeless powders may have changed the equation.
