The .360 No 5 Rook is an obsolete centerfire rifle cartridge. 
The .360 No 5 Rook is a straight rimmed cartridge originally designed for hunting small game and target shooting in rook rifles, although it was also used as a pistol cartridge.
The .360 No 5 Rook was introduced between 1875 and 1880 by lengthening the older .380 Long cartridge. This cartridge was initially available in both 134 gr (8.7 g) rifle loadings and 125 gr (8.1 g) pistol loadings, both cartridges being interchangeable. Shot and blank cartridges were also available.
As with other rook rifle cartridges, the .360 No 5 Rook was superseded as a small game hunting and target cartridge by the .22 Long Rifle.
