The .380 Long [9.8 x 24mmR], also known as the .380 Rook rifle, is an obsolete centerfire rifle cartridge. 
The .380 Long is a straight rimmed cartridge originally designed for use in rook rifles for target shooting and hunting game up to the size of smaller deer.
In addition to British munitions makers, the .380 Long was also made by DWM in Germany and a number of cheap European pistols were chambered in it. This cartridge is very similar to the .38 Long Colt and may have inspire the latter cartridge's development.
As with other rook rifle cartridges, the .380 Long was superseded as a small game hunting and target cartridge by the .22 Long Rifle. As a pistol cartridge, the .380 Long gradually lost favour to more modern rounds such as the .38 S&amp;W.
