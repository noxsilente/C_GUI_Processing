Prodotta per l'Esercito Svedese, e utilizzata nelle mitragliatrici Browning e Bofors dopo l'uso militare vide un ottimo successo in campo venatorio ma solo nei rispettivi Paesi, è pressochè sconosciuta negli altri.

The 8×63mm patron m/32 was a bottlenecked centrefire cartridge with a slightly (0.25 mm (0.0098 in)) rebated rim for Swedish heavy and medium machine guns. It was used from 1932 to the finalization of the re-chambering process of these machine guns to 7.62×51mm NATO in 1975.
In the late 1920s, the standard service cartridge in Swedish use was the 6.5×55mm Swedish skarp patron m/94 projektil m/94 (live cartridge m/94 projectile m/94) service ammunition loaded with a 10.1 grams (156 gr) long round-nosed m/94 (B-projectile) bullet which was not considered effective enough for anti-aircraft and indirect fire so the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration tasked AB Bofors to manufacture a larger rifle cartridge to meet these needs.
The patron m/32 round had the same overall length as the .30-06 Springfield cartridge, which allowed it to fit in the standard Browning receiver, but used a larger diameter case and like the 6.5×55mm had an uncommon 12.2 mm (0.48 in) diameter bolt face. Compared to the 1928 pattern .30-06 Springfield M1 Ball the 8×63mm patron m/32 was loaded with 8 mm S bore 14.2 g (219.1 gr) bullets and had more muzzle energy.
The patron m/32's boat-tailed spitzer bullets had an effective range of approximately 3,600 m (3,937 yd) on which the impact energy was 196 J (145 ftxlbf), and a maximum range of approximately 5,500 m (6,015 yd) when fired from a kulspruta m/36. Available with armour piercing bullets, patron m/32 was used in the UN-forces' KP-bil during the Congo-crisis against the separatists' armoured cars.
