The 4.5mm MKR was a Swedish prototype rimfire cartridge developed for the prototype Interdynamics MKR bullpup assault rifle and carbine. 
The 4.5x26 MKR was claimed to be on par with a 5.56Ã—45mm NATO M-193 bullet at up to 300 meters while one could carry 3.5 times the amount of cartridges. Its slender 4.5mm projectile could penetrate a steel helmet up to 300m out to which range it had a similar ballistic curve to the 5.56x45NATO with M-193 projectile. 
This was due to a combination of slightly higher velocity, a similar Ingalls ballistic coefficient to the M-193 bullet (0.245 vs 0.265), and the superior penetrating ability of solid cold-rolled copper bullets vs jacketed lead bullets given an equal sectional density. It was potentially lethal (80 Joules) up to 750m and its tendency to tumble on impact was twice that of the 5.56 M-193 bullet, thus ensuring more effective transfer of its diminutive energy to its target, especially as its tip tended to bend. Maximum range was 2,500m.
Due to concerns about stopping power, reliability, and problems with using rimfire ammunition, the MKR project was abandoned at the prototype stage and the 4.5mm MKR never saw service or any kind of widespread use.
