1893-'94 Fu la base dalla quale furono progettate moltissime munizioni militari Europee in calibro 6,5mm. ma questa non fu mai usata come munizione militare. E' uno dei 6,5mm più popolari in Europa, utilizzato moltissimo anche oggi. Il 6,5x57 deriva dal 7x57 Mauser ma può essere anche prodotta allargando il colletto della .257 Roberts.

The 6.5×57mm Mauser (designated as the 6,5 × 57 by the C.I.P.) is a smokeless powder rimless bottlenecked centerfire rifle cartridge developed by Paul Mauser and introduced in 1893–94. 
The 6.5×57mm Mauser was designed and introduced by Mauser in either 1893 or 1894 for use as a sporting cartridge, the cartridge was created by necking down the 7×57mm Mauser.
The 6.5×57mm Mauser never saw military service with any power, but it influenced the design of a number of 6.5mm military cartridges such as the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro. Several wildcat cartridges have subsequently been created from the 7×57mm Mauser with almost identical calibre bullets, such as the .257 Roberts, but are not interchangeable. The .256 Gibbs Magnum was created by reducing the neck of the 6.5×57mm Mauser by 2 mm.
One famous user of the 6.5×57mm Mauser was Pete Pearson, who used a rifle in this calibre for hunting in Africa. Pearson typically used his .577 Nitro Express double rifle for hunting dangerous game, but on occasion he did use the 6.5×57mm Mauser to hunt dangerous game up to and including elephant.
