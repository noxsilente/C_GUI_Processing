The .220 Russian (5.6×39mm) cartridge was developed in the late 1950s for deer hunting in Russia as well as 100 meter running deer competitions. It is a 7.62×39mm cartridge necked down to hold a 5.6 mm bullet. It was later adopted by Finland, and by around 1965 was being produced by SAKO and Lapua. When it was introduced to the United States, Sako, and later Lapua, brass was stamped ".220 Russian".
The .220 Russian is the parent case for the .22 PPC, 6mm PPC, and the 6.5mm Grendel cartridge.
