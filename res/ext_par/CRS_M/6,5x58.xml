The 6.5×58mm Vergueiro is a centerfire rimless cartridge designed in 1904 specifically for the Mauser-Vergueiro chosen as service rifle of the Portuguese Army. It was adopted to replace the rimmed 8×60mmR Guedes and 8×56mmR Kropatschek Corto cartridges originally filled with blackpowder, 
which had been used with Kropatschek rifles procured in the mid 1880s. Smokeless powder allowed for a higher velocity round and further calibre reduction to 6.5mm, a step already taken by other European countries, e.g. Sweden (6.5×55mm Swedish) and Italy (6.5×52mm Carcano).
It remained the service rifle cartridge until the Karabiner 98k replaced the Mauser-Vergueiro pattern in 1939. The round was also used for sporting purposes, manufacturers like DWM and Kynoch offered it until the 1960s.
In military use the common projectile weighs 155 grains and travels at up to 2400 feet (730 meters) per second. A lot of the Mauser-Vergueiro rifles were later rechambered to accept the standard 7.92×57mm cartridge of the newer Mauser 98k pattern.
