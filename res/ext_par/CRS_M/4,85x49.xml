The 4.85×49mm is an experimental intermediate firearm cartridge made by the United Kingdom for the Individual Weapon project, which became the SA80 series of small arms. 
The 4.85×49mm cartridge is based on the 5.56×45mm NATO, but uses a 5mm bullet and has a longer neck than the 5.56mm does. Muzzle velocity is better than the M193 5.56mm loading, which this cartridge was designed to compete against. The 4.85×49mm cartridge weighed 11.62 grams (179.3 gr).
